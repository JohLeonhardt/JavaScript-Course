//LET - is a MUTABLE VARIABLE
let age = 30;   // the here
age = 31;       // is called MUTATING

//CONST - is a INMUTABLE VARIABLE
const birthYear = 1991; //CONST creates a value 
//birthYear = 1990;       //that we can not reasign (INMUTABLE)

//const job;

// ---- only use LET if you are sure that the VARIABLE needs to change in the future, otherwise use CONST ------

var job = 'programmer';
